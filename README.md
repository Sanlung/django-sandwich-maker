$ git clone https://github.com/Sanlung/django-sandwich-maker.git <your_project_directory_name>
```

To clone using SSH run the following command:

```bash

In the same directory as `<your_local_project_name>/sandwichsite/sandwichsite/settings.py` file, create a `.env` file and, in it, save a secret key that you create. You may generate a key in the terminal like so:

```bash
$ shasum<<<test
```

A hash will be generated and printed to the terminal, which you can use as the key and save it in the `.env` file, like so:

```.env
SECRET_KEY=<the_hash_you_generated>
```

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it in your local project: (assuming you already have Python installed)

```bash
$ cd <your_local_project_directory_name>
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Install the packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the `sandwichsite/` directory run the following command to start the server:

```bash
$ cd sandwichsite
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
